### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
This project is part of the Udacity Programming for Data Science for Enterprise Nanadegree Program. The projects takes everything that was taught
in the Introduction to Python module, such as data types and operators, data structures, control flow, functions, and scripting. By building out this
project, I was able to put into use the Pandas module to load and process external data. By using the data on bike sharing in the United States, I was able to 
quickly answer the following questions using Pandas:

    1: Popular times of travel.
        a. What is the most common month?
        b. What is the most common day of week?
        c. What is the most common hour of day
    
    2: Popular stations and trip.
        a. What is the most common start station?
        b. What is the most common end station?
        c. What is the most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)?

    3: Trip Duration.
        a. What is the total travel time?
        b. What is the average travel time?
    
    4. User Info.
        a. What is the counts of each user type?
        b. What is the counts of each gender (the data is only available for NYC and Chicago)?
        c. What is the earliest, most recent, and most common year of birth (only in NYC and Chicago)?
    
    5. Raw Data
        a. The user is asked if he/she wants to view 5 rows of raw data and will continue to view the next five rows if they wish.

### Credits
Udacity course instructors for making learning fun and easy! The people who put the Python, Pandas, and Numpy documentation together. My wife for 
giving me the space and time to learn and become a better programmer. Without her none of this would be possible.
